/**
 * Interface for implementing different ranking strategies for search results.
 *
 * Each implementation should rank a set of document IDs based on a given search term
 * and the word frequency information provided.
 *
 * This supports the Open/Closed Principle â€” new ranking strategies can be introduced
 * without changing existing code, and clients depend on abstraction, not implementation.
 *
 * Returns:
 * - A list of document IDs ranked in descending order of relevance to the term
